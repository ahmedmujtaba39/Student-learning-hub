<h1 class="news-article-title" style="text-align: center;">Mohammed Hago wins Best Delegate at DAMMUN</h1>
<p class="news-article-meta">Published: December 2025 • By Student Council</p>


<p>
  Mohammed Hago represented NWIS at this year’s DAMMUN conference and was
  recognized with the <strong>Best Delegate</strong> award in the Special Committee.
  Over three days of intense debate, he consistently drove the discussion forward,
  proposed well‑researched solutions, and worked across blocs to build consensus.
</p>

<p>
  In the Special Committee sessions, Mohammed delivered detailed opening speeches,
  drafted high.impact clauses, and responded confidently to points of information
  from delegates around the region. His resolution on technology‑driven education
  reform ultimately gained broad support and passed with a strong majority.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of formal debate, he played a key role in guiding first‑time delegates
  from our school, helping them understand procedure, prepare speeches, and stay
  engaged in their own committees. The conference organizers highlighted his
  leadership, diplomacy, and teamwork as reasons for the Best Delegate recognition.
</p>

<p>
  Congratulations to Mohammed for bringing this award home to NWIS and setting a
  high standard for future DAMMUN delegations. Students interested in joining
  next year’s conference can reach out to the MUN club or Student Council for
  information on training sessions and tryouts.
